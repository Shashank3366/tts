# Voice LLM TTS Testing Project

This project automates the testing of 11Labs and Sarvam AI TTS APIs using text from a Word document.

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Open a terminal/command prompt in this folder and run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note: Ensure you have Python installed and added to your PATH.*
    *Note: `librosa` may require `ffmpeg` to be installed on your system for certain audio formats. If you encounter errors loading MP3 files, please install ffmpeg.*

2.  **Verify API Keys:**
    The script `tts_tester.py` is pre-configured with the API keys provided. 
    You can check or update them at the top of the file:
    ```python
    ELEVENLABS_API_KEY = "..."
    SARVAM_API_KEY = "..."
    ```

3.  **Prepare Input Data:**
    A sample file `english_test_texts.docx` has been created for you. You can edit this file or replace it with your own text content.

## Running the Test

Run the main script:
```bash
python tts_tester.py
```

## Output
The script will generate an `output` folder containing:
-   `11labs/`: Audio files generated by 11Labs.
-   `sarvam/`: Audio files generated by Sarvam AI.
-   `tts_comparison_report.csv`: A CSV report comparing Duration, Pitch, and RMS Energy for each text segment.

## Troubleshooting
-   **Audio Format Errors**: If `librosa` complains about audio formats, ensure `ffmpeg` is installed.
-   **API Errors**: Check your internet connection and API quota limits.
